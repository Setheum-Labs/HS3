### Overview

This package is a part of the DAGESTAN toolset. For more information, see the README
in the top-level directory.

Dagestan (DAGESTAN) is an asynchronous and Byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocol aimed at ordering arbitrary messages (transactions). It has been designed to continuously operate even in the harshest conditions: with no bounds on message-delivery delays and in the presence of malicious actors. This makes it an excellent fit for blockchain-related applications.
