### Overview

This package is a part of the StanceBFT toolset. For more information, see the README
in the top-level directory.

StanceBFT is an asynchronous and Byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocol aimed at ordering arbitrary messages (transactions). It has been designed to continuously operate even in the harshest conditions: with no bounds on message-delivery delays and in the presence of malicious actors. This makes it an excellent fit for blockchain-related applications. It is built using the codebase ALEPH-BFT.
